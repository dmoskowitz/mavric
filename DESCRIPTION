Title: Measuring Association between Variance and Covariates
Version: 0.0.0.9004
Authors@R: person("David", "Moskowitz", email = "dmosk@stanford.edu", role =
    "cre")
Description: Provides estimates of the percentage of variance in
    data due to each of the user-supplied covariates. It additionally offers
    information regarding the confounding between those covariates. The
    underlying methodology is built upon PCA, from which MAVRIC also extracts
    those measured elements from the data that are statistically different
    between pairs of categories within covariates.
